 * The `convoy-` prefix keeps the `/convoy-spin` command from colliding with an
 * operator-authored `/spin`. No plugin, no bin shim, no per-repo artifacts;
 * the old install's scope was its failure. Idempotent, versioned, and touches

Run \`convoy spin\` in the repository with the shell and report its output verbatim.

Do not run git commands yourself, do not infer or name branches, and do not create
worktrees — convoy owns all of that. If the output lists several changes to pick
from, ask me which one and run \`convoy spin --change <id>\`. If it reports a
refusal (dirty tree, no change), relay the message as-is.`
