/**
 * The advisor←executor pattern, emulated over OpenCode's own APIs.
 *
 * A step's executor owns the loop, the tools, and the deliverable. At its
 * decision points it consults a stronger advising model that runs OUTSIDE that
 * loop: a single stateless prompt with every tool disabled, over the executor's
 * verbatim transcript. Only the advice text re-enters the executor's context —
 * never the advisor's reasoning — so intention is never re-serialized across a
 * handoff boundary, which is the failure mode that makes plan-then-execute
 * pipelines lose the plan.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and easy to break:
 *
 * 1. The advisor never gets tools. With tools it becomes an orchestrator and the
 *    cost argument inverts — the whole point is that the expensive model emits
 *    hundreds of tokens, not the deliverable.
 * 2. Failure degrades, it never fails the phase. An unavailable advisor returns
 *    guidance saying so, and the executor carries on.
